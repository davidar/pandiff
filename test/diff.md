1.  Lorem ipsum dolor {++sit ++}amet

I really love *italic {~~fonts~>font-styles~~}* {~~here.~>there.~~}

``` diff
 print("Hello")
-print("world.")
+print("world!")
 print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt")
```

Don’t go around saying {--to people that --}the world owes you a
living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first. {~~One~>Only
one~~} thing is impossible for God: To find{++ any++} sense in any
copyright law on the planet. Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is
because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn’t.
