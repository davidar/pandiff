I really love /italic fonts/ here.

    print("Hello")
    print("world.")
    print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Don't go around saying to people that the world owes you a living. The
world owes you nothing. It was here first. One thing is impossible for
God: To find sense in any copyright law on the planet. Truth is stranger
than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to
possibilities; Truth isn't.
