1.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2.  [consectetur adipiscing
    elit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)
3.  Lorem dolor sit amet

I really love *italic font-styles* there.

    print("Hello")
    print("world!")
    print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt")

Don’t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you
nothing. It was here first. Only one thing is impossible for God: To
find any sense in any copyright law on the planet. Truth is stranger
than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to
possibilities; Truth isn’t.
